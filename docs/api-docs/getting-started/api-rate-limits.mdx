# Adaptive concurrency limits

BigCommerce aims to ensure outstanding platform reliability. To maintain dependability, we recommend adhering to industry-standard rate limiting when developing.

## Overview

Apps using OAuth are rate-limited based on a quota refreshed every few seconds. The maximum quota varies by store plan and requested resources:

| Plan Type| Quota |
|:------------------|:-------|
| Enterprise and Enterprise-Test | by plan and [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| Other sandboxes (Dev/Partner/Employee) | by [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| Pro | 60k per hour (450 / 30sec) |
| Plus & Standard | 20k per hour (150 / 30sec) | 

  The **Unlimited** rate plan for select BigCommerce Enterprise clients is not rate limited by requests per time but may face physical infrastructure-related constraints that may limit the maximum throughput of requests for a given resource. For more on resource constraints, see [object-related limits (Help Center)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits).

  **BigCommerce reserves the right to limit unreasonable API activity for platform stability, per our [Terms of Service](https://www.bigcommerce.com/terms/api-terms/).**
</Callout>

Each API request consumes one quota unit. When the quota is reached, subsequent requests are rejected until the quota is refreshed. A store's quota is shared across all apps accesing the store, preventing a single app from using the entire quota. The available quota for an app adjusts as other clients make or stop requests.

## Rate limit methods
To manage your platform's resources effectively, use the following practices.

### Handle rate limit status codes

<Callout type="info">
  As of January 2022, BigCommerce header field names are case-insensitive. Learn more about BigCommerce [response header conventions](/docs/start/about#response-headers).
</Callout>

API response headers show your position in the rate-limiting algorithm:

```http filename="Standard plan example: Rate limit headers"
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Ms: 30000
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota: 150
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left: 35
```

A [429: Too Many Requests](/docs/start/about/status-codes#4xx-client-error) response indicates that the rate limits are met for this request. The `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header shows when to retry.

For more details on response headers, see [About Our API](/docs/start/about#bigcommerce-specific-response-headers).

### Distribute the load

Spread requests over time to avoid spikes.

### Caching results

Cache frequent results to reduce API calls.

### Retry requests responsibly

On receiving a `429` response, pause further requests until the quota refreshes:

```http filename="Example: 429 response" showLineNumbers copy
  HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
  Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2022 20:36:00 GMT
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
```

Use the `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-MS` header to wait before retrying:

```php filename="PHP example for delaying response" showLineNumbers copy
  $milliseconds = $response->getHeader("X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms");
  usleep($milliseconds);
```
