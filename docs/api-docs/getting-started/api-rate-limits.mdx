# Adaptive concurrency limits

BigCommerce aims to provide you with an outstanding level of platform reliability. To keep platforms dependable, it's encouraged to practice industry-standard rate limiting when building.

## Overview

Apps that authenticate with OAuth are rate-limited based on a quota that is refreshed every few seconds. The maximum quota for a store will vary depending on the store plan and resources requested.

| Plans & sandboxes | Quotas |
|:------------------|:-------|
| Enterprise plans and Enterprise sandboxes (Enterprise-Test) | by plan\* and [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| All other sandboxes (Dev/Partner/Employee) | by [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| Pro plans| 60k per hour (450 / 30sec) |
| Plus & Standard plans| 20k per hour (150 / 30sec) | 

<Callout type="warning">
  \* The **Unlimited** rate plan for select BigCommerce Enterprise clients means that these stores are not rate limited by number of requests per unit of time. However, there are physical infrastructure-related constraints that may limit the maximum throughput of requests for a given resource. For more on resource constraints, consult our article on [object-related limits (Help Center)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits).
  
  BigCommerce reserves the right to limit unreasonable or abusive API activity in the interest of platform stability, per our [Terms of Service](https://www.bigcommerce.com/terms/api-terms/).

Each request to the API consumes one available request from the quota. When an app hits the quota limit, subsequent requests are rejected until the quota is refreshed.

A store’s overall quota is distributed across all apps that are accessing that store at a given time. This prevents a single app from consuming the store’s entire quota by itself. The quota available to a single app adjusts as additional clients start and stop making requests.

## Rate limit methods
There are plenty of ways to effectively manage your platform's resources.

The follwing practices are useful to apply:

* Handle rate limit status codes
* Distribute the load evenly across time
* Cache results
* Retry requests responsibly

### Handle rate limit status codes

<Callout type="info">
  As of January 2022, BigCommerce header field names became functionally case-insensitive. Learn more about BigCommerce [response header conventions](/docs/start/about#response-headers).
</Callout>

Every API response’s HTTP headers give you full visibility into your position in the rate-limiting algorithm:

```http filename="Standard plan example: Rate limit headers"
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Ms: 30000
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota: 150
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left: 35
```

If your implementation's request to the API triggers a [429: Too Many Requests](/docs/start/about/status-codes#4xx-client-error) response, it is encountering rate limits. Responses contain the `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header, which specifies the time in milliseconds that your client must wait before its quota refreshes. Retry the request after this time has elapsed.

For more about rate limit headers and how to calculate the timing of your requests to reduce the risk of encoutering rate limits, see [About Our API](/docs/start/about#bigcommerce-specific-response-headers).

### Distrube the load

### Caching results

### Retrying requests responsibly

When you see a response with an HTTP `429` status code, your client shouldn’t make any further requests until your quota has refreshed:

```http filename="Example: 429 response" showLineNumbers copy
  HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
  Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2022 20:36:00 GMT
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
```

Parse the `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header to determine how long you have to wait. In this case, it would be 15000 milliseconds.
Your client can sleep on the specified interval:

```php filename="PHP example for delaying response" showLineNumbers copy
  $milliseconds = $response->getHeader("X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms");
  usleep($milliseconds);
```

After waiting for the given number of milliseconds, your client can go back to making API requests.
