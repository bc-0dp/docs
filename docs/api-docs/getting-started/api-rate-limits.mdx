# Adaptive concurrency limits

BigCommerce aims to provide outstanding platform reliability. We encourage industry-standard rate limiting practices for developers.

## Overview

Apps using OAuth are rate-limited based on a quota refreshed every few seconds. The maximum quota varies by store plan and requested resources:

| Plan Type| Quota |
|:------------------|:-------|
| Enterprise and Enterprise-Test | by plan and [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| Other sandboxes (Dev/Partner/Employee) | by [resource](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits) | 
| Pro | 60k per hour (450 / 30sec) |
| Plus & Standard | 20k per hour (150 / 30sec) | 


  The **Unlimited** rate plan for select BigCommerce Enterprise clients is not rate limited by requests per time but may face physical infrastructure-related constraints that may limit the maximum throughput of requests for a given resource. For more on resource constraints, see [object-related limits (Help Center)](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Platform-Limits#storelimits).

<Callout type="warning">
  **BigCommerce reserves the right to limit unreasonable API activity for platform stability, per our [Terms of Service](https://www.bigcommerce.com/terms/api-terms/).**
</Callout>

Each request to the API consumes one available request from the quota. When an app reaches the quota limit, subsequent requests are rejected until the quota is refreshed.

Each API request consumes one quota unit. When the quota is reached, requests are rejected until it refreshes. Quotas are shared across all apps accessing a store.

## Rate limit methods
To manage your platform's resources effectively, use these practices:

* Handle rate limit status codes
* Distribute load evenly
* Cache results
* Retry requests responsibly

### Handle rate limit status codes

<Callout type="info">
  As of January 2022, BigCommerce header field names are case-insensitive. Learn more about BigCommerce [response header conventions](/docs/start/about#response-headers).
</Callout>

API response headers show your position in the rate-limiting algorithm:

```http filename="Standard plan example: Rate limit headers"
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Window-Ms: 30000
X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Quota: 150
X-Rate-Limit-Requests-Left: 35
```

A [429: Too Many Requests](/docs/start/about/status-codes#4xx-client-error) response indicates that the rate limits are met for this request. The `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms` header shows when to retry.

For more details on response headers, see [About Our API](/docs/start/about#bigcommerce-specific-response-headers).

### Distribute the load

Spread requests over time to avoid spikes.

### Caching results

Cache frequent results to reduce API calls.

### Retry requests responsibly

On recieving a `429` response, pause further requests unitl the quota refreshes:

```http filename="Example: 429 response" showLineNumbers copy
  HTTP/1.1 429 Too Many Requests
  Date: Mon, 03 Feb 2022 20:36:00 GMT
  Content-Type: application/json
  X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms: 15000
```

Use the `X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-MS` header to wait before retrying:

```php filename="PHP example for delaying response" showLineNumbers copy
  $milliseconds = $response->getHeader("X-Rate-Limit-Time-Reset-Ms");
  usleep($milliseconds);
```
