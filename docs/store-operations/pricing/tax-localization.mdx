Currently, you use separate storefront channels for each country/region to localize the shopping experience. While price lists can be assigned per storefront, there's an issue: some regions require tax-inclusive pricing, while others use tax-exclusive pricing. The current system only supports one global tax setting, so it becomes difficult for you to set appropriate pricing strategies for different regions with varying tax expectations.

- Define whether prices on a price list are inclusive or exclusive of tax.
- Aassign tax-inclusive or tax-exclusive price lists to multiple storefronts or customer groups.

## Out of Scope

- Stores using Catalog V2, due to fixed pricing rules.
- Product modifier rules.
- Mixing inclusive and exclusive pricing within a single price list.
- Multi-geo setup on a single storefront.
- Gift wrapping feature.
- Catalog price "fallthrough"; you must use the "lowest variant price" settings for PLP and PDP.

## Settings

- Price lists will include a new setting to specify whether prices are tax-inclusive, tax-exclusive, or global.

- Global Price Lists:

Global price lists follow the current setup, inheriting the global tax setting. They will function as they do today and allow for product modifiers and gift wrapping.

- Tax-Inclusive/Exclusive Price Lists:

You must explicitly set a price list as inclusive or exclusive. Once set, these lists won't inherit global tax settings and will not default to catalog prices if a price is missing. Products on such lists will not display or be purchasable without an entered price. Product modifiers, gift wrapping, and shipping will follow the entered prices.

## Technical Details

- Price lists will have their own "entered as" setting, which overrides the global store setting. This can be either tax-inclusive, tax-exclusive, or global.
- If not explicitly set, a price list will inherit the global setting.
- You can change the "entered as" setting on a price list at any time.
