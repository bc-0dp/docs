# Price Lists - International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront

<Callout type="info">
  Tax-inclusive or exclusive price lists are in beta. Features may change based on user feedback or internal testing.
</Callout>

_International Enhancements for Multi-Storefront_ allow you to deliver localized experiences to fit different shopper needs. 

Shoppers expect storefront prices to include or exclude tax depending on their region when you sell internationally. 

When you create separate storefront channels for each region, you may need some storefronts to display prices that include tax, while others display prices that exclude tax.

To do so, specify whether a price list has prices that include or exclude tax when entered. Then assign the price list to storefront channels.

## Limitations

- Stores using [Catalog V2](/docs/store-operations/catalog/migration) have fixed pricing and will use global store settings. 
- You cannot enter price changes due to product modifier rules, gift wrapping features, and fixed shipping prices into a price list. These inherit global settings and always apply on top of the price list.
- You cannot mix inclusive and exclusive pricing within a single price list.
- You must [set the display price](https://support.bigcommerce.com/s/article/Product-Display-Settings?language=en_US#settings) to the lowest variant price when a shopper's preselected options don't match to a price. 

If your store doesn't have multiple storefronts, you can still create tax-inclusive or exclusive price lists and assign them to customer groups.

## Settings

Price lists will have a `prices_entered_with_tax` setting, which overrides the (default) global store setting. Use this setting to choose whether the price list is tax-inclusive or exclusive, or inherits the global settings. For details, see the [Price List endpoints](/docs/rest-management/price-lists) in the REST Management APIs.

When you're using tax-inclusive price lists, tax-inclusive prices remain the same across all tax zones; the tax amount will vary based on the shopper's location. 

If you're inheriting global tax settings, there is an additional option for tax-inclusive prices. The store can subtract the item's store tax rate before calculating tax using the shopper's tax zone. For information on the global settings, see the [Tax Settings](/docs/rest-management/tax-settings) endpoint of the REST Management API. 

## Example

The following example creates a tax-inclusive price list by sending a request to the [Create a Price List](/docs/rest-management/price-lists#create-a-price-list) endpoint. 

<Tabs items={['Request', 'Response']}>
  <Tab>

  ```http filename="Example request: Create a tax-inclusive price list" showLineNumbers copy
  POST https://api.bigcommerce.com/stores/{{store_hash}}/v3/pricelists
  X-Auth-Token: {{ACCESS_TOKEN}}
  Accept: application/json
  Content-Type: application/json

  {
    "name": "Wholesale",
    "active": true,
    "prices_entered_with_tax": "entered_inclusive"
  }
  ```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

  ```json filename="Example response: Create a tax-inclusive price list" showLineNumbers copy
  {
    "data": {
      "id": 4,
      "name": "Wholesale Group - Trade Show",
      "date_created": "2022-09-17T18:41:59Z",
      "date_modified": "2022-09-17T18:41:59Z",
      "active": false,
      "prices_entered_with_tax": "entered_inclusive"
    },
    "meta": {}
  }
  ```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>


## Fallback behavior

The following fallback behavior applies if you set a product as available for purchase, but the price list doesn't have a price entered for the product.

When a price list inherits global settings: 
- Price lists will default to catalog prices if a price is missing. 

When a price list overrides the global store setting:
- Prices returned will be `null` if a price is missing in the price list. This applies for the prices returned in the [Pricing](/docs/rest-management/pricing/products) endpoint of the REST Management API and the [GraphQL Storefront API](/docs/storefront/graphql). 
- On Stencil storefronts, the product, but not the price, will still be visible. You won't be able to purchase it, but you can still add to wishlist.
